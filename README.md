# Predictive-Reactive-Learning-Framework-for-Cellular-Connected-UAVs
This repository contains the simulation code and results for the paper:
A Predictive-Reactive Learning Framework for Cellular-Connected UAV Handover in Urban Heterogeneous Networks
Authors: Muhammad Abrar Afzal, Luis Alonso
Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC-BarcelonaTECH)
The code implements:
3GPP-compliant channel models for Urban Macro (UMa) environments
UAV mobility with sinusoidal trajectories
Standard 3GPP A3 handover mechanism (baseline)
Tabular Q-learning handover optimization
Deep Q-Network (DQN) handover approach
Predictive-Reactive Q-Learning Framework (PRQF) with XGBoost gating 
Simulation results include handover reduction, throughput, SINR plots, and generated data.
